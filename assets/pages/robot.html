                I was a member of a team working on creating a VEX robot. This was a very challenging
                project for me since
                this was my first time working on any robot. The project was to first create the robot and
                then configure it to run through an obstacle course. The wooden obstacle
                course consists of ramps and walls. We had to configure the robot to run on both autonomous
                and the remote controlled mode. In remote controlled mode, we had to use
                a controller to run as many laps as possible in three minutes. While autonomous mode was
                more challenging since passing the obstacles solely depended on
                the motors and sensors. We used ultrasonic sensors to detect walls in order to make turns.

                This project gave me great experience in multiple areas.
