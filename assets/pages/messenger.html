                            This project included implementing a secure messenger system that can be used in a hospital.
                            The first step to creating this system was to write acceptance tests and actual tests. I
                            also met with the clients(in this case
                            the TA and the professor) to derive user requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            The users(e.g. doctors, nurses, administrators) first have to register to the system using
                            an ID and a name. The messenger system must support the
                            ability of users to send text messages.
                            There are also groups and users are members of groups and when they send a message it is
                            always to a group, with the privacy condition that only
                            members of that group may read the message. Users may become members of any number of
                            groups. Users may send messages only to the members of a group
                            they are registered in. Users may only access/read a message from a group they are
                            registered in.
                            Once a message is read by the recipient, its status changes from new to old. Users may
                            delete their old messages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The system provides the following queries: list_users (ID → name) and list_groups (ID →
                            name), both sorted by name.
                            Components of the abstract state are always sorted by ID, except for the list of users, or
                            lists of groups (as above).
                            Lists of new and old messages for a user, are sorted by message ID. The other commands are:
                            add_user(user_id, name),add_group(group_id,g_name),
                            register_user(user_id,group_id), list_old_messages(user_id), list_new_messages(user_id),
                            set_message_preview(char_count),
                            delete_message(user_id,message_id), read_message(user_id,message_id), send_message(user_id,
                            group_id,message),

                            Each user command shall be followed by the abstract state space. Queries shall display
                            results only, not the abstract state.

                            I created this system using JAVA. I exploited the properties of "Maps", "Sets", "Lists" and
                            "Iterators".

                            I achieved the project goal within the given time frame and met the client requirements.

                            This was a great learning experience in the area of software development. I had an
                            opportunity to learn to write acceptance tests, actual tests and use cases.
                            I also learned that elicitating the user requirements is just as important as writing the
                            code.
