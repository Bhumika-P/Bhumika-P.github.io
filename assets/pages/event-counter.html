                The idea of this project originated from my husband who thought wouldn't it be nice if there
                was an app that would calculate how much time has passed since
                the special event and calculates how much time left till the monthly/yearly anniversary of
                that event? So I decided to tackle this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created this app on the Express framework using GoormIDE. I plan to have user
                authentication on the app. The users can register and login
                in the app, and enter the event they want to track. The app will calculate how much time has
                passed since the event, and calculate how much time
                has left until the monthly/anniversary date. I am planning to use the MongoDB database to
                store user and event information. I am also using Bootstrap 4 for
                the responsiveness of the application. I am also using RESTful routes for cleaner URLs. At
                this point, I have written most of the routes and planning to work on user authentication.
