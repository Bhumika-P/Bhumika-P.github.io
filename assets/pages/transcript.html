                I had the opportunity to help an online school with their transcript generation process. Their process was manual which included 
                a Microsoft Word template that the admins would use to input student information, courses, credit hours, grade and GPA. The process was tedious and resulted in many errors and typos.
                I suggested making a desktop application that employees can use. I derived user requirements directly from the client and worked closely with the content manager.
            </p>
            <p>
               I used Electron framework to create a cross platform desktop application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used a JSON file to add all the curriculums and course data.
               After all the data was inputted with the help of the content manager, I created a user friendly UI that would allow the user to add student personal information,
               course number and grade. The program would then autopopulate the course names and credit hours. The script I created also calculated the GPA and total credit hours.
               This application greatly minimized the human errors and dramatically reduced the time it takes to generate a transcript.
