                            This was a great in-class project which helped me dive further into mobile app development.
                            My project was very critical since it included dealing with
                            a serious medical condition. AMD means age-related macular degeneration. It is deterioration
                            of the macula, which is the small central area of the retina of the eye that
                            controls visual acuity. It produces a slow, painless loss of vision and the patient loses
                            central vision. They can not see fine details, whether they're looking
                            at something close or far.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I created the app using Android studio. I also used a Firebase database to store the patient
                            information, test results and test patterns.
                            The patients first had to register and then login in order to use the application.
                            The mobile app included showing random straight lines of different sizes with a red dot in
                            the center. The AMD patients may see some of
                            the lines as wavy or blurred, with some dark areas at center. The app included displaying
                            lines one after another and the patient will tap/voice "yes" if they see
                            the line straight or "no" if they don't see a straight line. The test results were stored in
                            the Firebase database for later use and also displayed in the app.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was a very memorable experience for me. I had many failures along the way but I was
                            able to achieve the goal and meet the deadline for the project.
                        </p>
