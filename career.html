                        <p>
                            This position has really allowed me to grow in my career. My responsibilities include web development, content management, accessibility and training.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In regards to accessibility, I created training materials and conducted live training for faculty and staff on creating digital accessibility. I also
                            continuously improve the accessibility of the website which resulted in 15% increase in the accessibility pushing to WCAG AA compliance. This requires running accessibility tests using automated checkers, screen reader
                            tests and keyboard accessibility tests. I document the accessibility issues and solutions in detail and collaborate with senior Web Developers to implement 
                            those changes. I also serve as a member of accessibility training subcommittee to find ways to increase accessibility awareness and brainstorm ideas to train fellow employees.
                            In addition, I also remediate PDF documents for accessibility and upload them on the website in a timely manner.
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            I create webpages, manage the existing content and contribute to Jira service board. I also assist with troubleshooting website bugs and provide solutions.
                            I participate in UAT for the new components we add to the system which includes testing and documenting bugs. 
                            I also manager over 180 users in the TerminalFour CMS and assist them with any errors or questions. Recently I have been working on improving the website 
                            load speed using CDN/PXL so the website can rank higher in the search engine. This project included extensive research. I tested this feature in a test 
                            environment so that it would not affect the whole website. I collaborated with other Web Developers to brainstorm ideas and created a roll out 
                            plan based on the project deadline. We started with small changes, documented the changes in page load speed and bugs. Overall I have learned alot in this position 
                            and I strive to learn more!

                                My job was to create a website for the school and manage it. 
                            <p>
                                I created the website on Weebly platform with student registration, login, and eCommerce. My
                                main goal was to make the website user-friendly where students who are not so comfortable with
                                computers
                                can navigate the website with ease.
                                My other responsibilities were to manage the website, answer technical inquiries
                                and professionally edit the textbooks.

                                    I had the opportunity to work at Primitius International as a freelance application developer.
                                    It was a great learning experience.
                                    My project included creating a survey analyzer for electronically interpreting and evaluating an
                                    18-page natural health survey questionnaire.
                                </p>
                                <p>I developed the application on electron framework using front-end technology such as JavaScript,
                                    CSS, and HTML. The project included reading
                                    the pdf form of the survey line by line and create a ROF - report of findings which addresses
                                    the priority level of health problems of the person
                                    who took the survey. I successfully reduced the time it takes to analyze the survey by
                                    approximately 67%. Originally it used to take 15-30 mins to analyze and
                                    evaluate the sruvey. Now with the help of the analyzer app it takes less than 5 minutes.
                                    I loved this project since it made me think outside the box and gave me more experience in the
                                    area of being very precise with the data.

                                        I had a great opportunity to participate in the creation of the student portal for New Eden
                                        School Of Natural Health and Herbal Study.
                                        The student portal was created using WordPress and I was in charge of the making the UI
                                        user-appealing and user-friendly.
                                        I was also responsible for attaining the user requirements from the client.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After the portal was created, I worked as a portal management administration assistant. I was
                                        responsible for assisting the lead administrator with managing the
                                        students and also inputting the exams manually on the portal. I also helped the students with
                                        technical and non-technical inquiries which helped me identify the bugs
                                        in the portal.
                
                                        It was a great experience and it helped me develop my administration skills and web-development
                                        skills further.
