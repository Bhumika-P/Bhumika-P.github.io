                        I graduated as a Computer Engineer in February 2018. One of my favorite mottoes is "There is always room for improvement". 
                        And I thrive to apply it in my life. As a kid, I was fascinated with computers and it didn't take me long to decide what I wanted to pursue in my career. 
                        I have explored many avenues in my career and I have learned that I enjoy programming where I can be creative.

                        I like web design, web development, and software development. I am a very creative person and I love to pour my creativity into my work. I am a quick learner and I like learning new things. I am also extremely resourceful. 
                        If I don't know how to do something, I figure it out! I am very eager to further my knowledge and skills. My vision is to keep moving forward in my career.

                        I like challenges in my position. Web development has become a perfect challenging outlet where I can apply my creativity. 
                        I love seeing the results of my efforts in helping users and the company. I also love the logic and structure of coding and strive to write scalable and efficient code. 
                        My current position as a Digital Accessibility Developer has greatly increased my accessibility awareness. 
                        I am passionate about creating an accessible design that helps a wide variety of audiences. 
                        I am also a problem solver. I have a knack for identifying and solving bugs in code.

                        I enjoy doing things with my family and friends. I like playing video games, reading novels, and cooking. I love working out and taking bike rides. 
                        My love for food and coffee is eternal. Baking with my family is one of my favorite things to do. I also enjoy decorating and organizing. 
                        I like living in an organized environment as opposed to clutter. Others have told me that I think outside the box to get something done.
