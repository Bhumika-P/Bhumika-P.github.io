                        I am Bhumika Bergman, a fellow computer engineer. I graduated in February 2018. This portfolio
                        will give you insight into my career, projects and contact information.


                        One of my favorite mottoes is "There is always room for Improvement". And I thrive to apply it
                        in my life. As a kid, I was fascinated with computers and it didn't
                        take me long to decide what I wanted to pursue in my future. I have explored many venues in my
                        career and I have learned that I really enjoy programming.
                        I like web-development, software development. I am a very creative person and I love to pour my
                        creativity into my work. I am a quick learner and I like learning
                        new things. I am very eager to further my knowledge and skills. My vision is to keep moving
                        forward in my career.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Other than programming, I enjoy doing things with my family and friends. I like playing video
                        games, reading novels and cooking.
                        I love working out and taking bike rides. My love for food and coffee is eternal. Baking with my
                        family is one of my favorite things to do.
                        I also enjoy decorating and organizing. I like living in an organized environment as opposed to
                        clutter.
                        Others have told me that I think outside the box to get something done.

                    <p>
                        Now I would like to talk a little about my background. I was born in India. After highschool, I
                        enrolled in
                        Computer Engineering at MS University located at Gujarat, India in May 2011. After two years of
                        engineering, I moved to Toronto, Canada in May 2013.
                        I wanted to continue schooling in Computer Engineering at York University but I was told that
                        I have to start from beginning and I can't continue where I left off back in India because most
                        of my credits weren't recognized
                        . I started studying first year
                        Computer Engineering in September 2013. And I graduated in February 2018. During my university
                        time, I met my soulmate and we eventually got engaged.
                        After that, I acquired a K-1 visa and moved to Chicago, IL in December 2018.
                        I married my fiance on February 23, 2019.
                        I then applied for both green card and work permit. Hence I acquired a work permit and I am
                        eligible to work in the USA.
                        Currently, I am actively looking for a position
                        as an entry-level front-end/software developer in the Chicago area.

                        Recently, I was offered an opportunity to work at National Institute For Optimal Wellness as a
                        front-end website developer and website manager.
                        My job is to create a website for the school and manage it. <a

                        main goal was to make the website user-friendly where students who are not so comfortable with
                        computers
                        can navigate the website with ease.
                        My other responsibilities are to manage the website, answer technical inquiries of the students
                        and professionally edit the textbooks.

                        I had the opportunity to work at Primitius International as a freelance application developer.
                        It was a great learning experience.
                        My project included creating a survey analyzer for electronically interpreting and evaluating an
                        18-page natural health survey questionnaire.
                    </p>
                    <p>I developed the application on electron framework using front-end technology such as JavaScript,
                        CSS, and HTML. The project included reading
                        the pdf form of the survey line by line and create a ROF - report of findings which addresses
                        the priority level of health problems of the person
                        who took the survey. I successfully reduced the time it takes to analyze the survey by
                        approximately 67%. Originally it used to take 15-30 mins to analyze and
                        evaluate the sruvey. Now with the help of the analyzer app it takes less than 5 minutes.
                        I loved this project since it made me think outside the box and gave me more experience in the
                        area of being very precise with the data.

                        After the portal was created, I worked as a portal management administration assistant. I was
                        responsible for assisting the lead administrator with managing the
                        students and also inputting the exams manually on the portal. I also helped the students with
                        technical and non-technical inquiries which helped me identify the bugs
                        in the portal.

                        It was a great experience and it helped me develop my administration skills and web-development
                        skills further.

                            I was offered a great opportunity to participate in the creation of content for Gemini
                            Station, a browser based space rpg game, created by Jon Wenzel.
                            The project that I am currently working on is a technology tree/hierarchy with tooltips. We
                            are developing this appliction on github pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                            Currently we have json data from MySQL database that we are using to create the hierarchy
                            along with many JavaScript libraries.

                        <p>
                            The idea of this project originated from my husband who thought wouldn't it be nice if there
                            was an app that would calculate how much time has passed since
                            the special event and calculates how much time left till the monthly/yearly anniversary of
                            that event? So I decided to tackle this project.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am creating this app on the Express framework using GoormIDE. I plan to have user
                            authentication on the app. The users can register and login
                            in the app, and enter the event they want to track. The app will calculate how much time has
                            passed since the event, and calculate how much time
                            has left until the monthly/anniversary date. I am planning to use the MongoDB database to
                            store user and event information. I am also using Bootstrap 4 for
                            the responsiveness of the application. I am also using RESTful routes for cleaner URLs. At
                            this point, I have written most of the routes and planning to work on user authentication.

                        <p>
                            This was a great in-class project which helped me dive further into mobile app development.
                            My project was very critical since it included dealing with
                            a serious medical condition. AMD means age-related macular degeneration. It is deterioration
                            of the macula, which is the small central area of the retina of the eye that
                            controls visual acuity. It produces a slow, painless loss of vision and the patient loses
                            central vision. They can not see fine details, whether they're looking
                            at something close or far.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I created the app using Android studio. I also used a Firebase database to store the patient
                            information, test results and test patterns.
                            The patients first had to register and then login in order to use the application.
                            The mobile app included showing random straight lines of different sizes with a red dot in
                            the center. The AMD patients may see some of
                            the lines as wavy or blurred, with some dark areas at center. The app included displaying
                            lines one after another and the patient will tap/voice "yes" if they see
                            the line straight or "no" if they don't see a straight line. The test results were stored in
                            the Firebase database for later use and also displayed in the app.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This was a very memorable experience for me. I had many failures along the way but I was
                            able to achieve the goal and meet the deadline for the project.

                        <p>
                            This project included implementing a secure messenger system that can be used in a hospital.
                            The first step to creating this system was to write acceptance tests and actual tests. I
                            also met with the clients(in this case
                            the TA and the professor) to derive user requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            The users(e.g. doctors, nurses, administrators) first have to register to the system using
                            an ID and a name. The messenger system must support the
                            ability of users to send text messages.
                            There are also groups and users are members of groups and when they send a message it is
                            always to a group, with the privacy condition that only
                            members of that group may read the message. Users may become members of any number of
                            groups. Users may send messages only to the members of a group
                            they are registered in. Users may only access/read a message from a group they are
                            registered in.
                            Once a message is read by the recipient, its status changes from new to old. Users may
                            delete their old messages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The system provides the following queries: list_users (ID → name) and list_groups (ID →
                            name), both sorted by name.
                            Components of the abstract state are always sorted by ID, except for the list of users, or
                            lists of groups (as above).
                            Lists of new and old messages for a user, are sorted by message ID. The other commands are:
                            add_user(user_id, name),add_group(group_id,g_name),
                            register_user(user_id,group_id), list_old_messages(user_id), list_new_messages(user_id),
                            set_message_preview(char_count),
                            delete_message(user_id,message_id), read_message(user_id,message_id), send_message(user_id,
                            group_id,message),

                            Each user command shall be followed by the abstract state space. Queries shall display
                            results only, not the abstract state.

                            I created this system using JAVA. I exploited the properties of "Maps", "Sets", "Lists" and
                            "Iterators".

                            I achieved the project goal within the given time frame and met the client requirements.

                            This was a great learning experience in the area of software development. I had an
                            opportunity to learn to write acceptance tests, actual tests and use cases.
                            I also learned that elicitating the user requirements is just as important as writing the
                            code.

                            This project was about creating a smart water bottle. I was a team member of the software
                            team. The main function of the water bottle is to
                            measure and monitor the hydration of the user. We created the mobile application using
                            Android Studio. The app interacts with the bottle using Bluetooth.
                            When the user uses the bottle to drink water, the hardware keeps a record of the fluid level
                            and sends the data to the mobile app. The user can then interacts
                            with the app to check the hydration level.

                            We achieved the project goal within the limited time frame.

                            This was a challenging project for me since it involved interaction with hardware using
                            short-range technology such as Bluetooth. Anyhow I enjoyed
                            learning something new.

                            I was a team member of a team working on creating a VEX robot. This was a very challenging
                            project for me since
                            this was my first time working on any robot. The project was to first create the robot and
                            then configure it to run through an obstacle course. The wooden obstacle
                            course consists of ramps and walls. We had to configure the robot to run on both autonomous
                            and the remote controlled mode. In remote controlled mode, we had to use
                            a controller to run as many laps as possible in three minutes. While autonomous mode was
                            more challenging since passing the obstacles solely depended on
                            the motors and sensors. We used ultrasonic sensors to detect walls in order to make turns.
