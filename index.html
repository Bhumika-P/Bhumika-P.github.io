                        I graduated as a Computer Engineer in February 2018. One of my favorite mottoes is "There is always room for improvement". 
                        And I thrive to apply it in my life. As a kid, I was fascinated with computers and it didn't take me long to decide what I wanted to pursue in my career. 
                        I have explored many avenues in my career and I have learned that I enjoy programming where I can be creative.

                        I like web design, web development, and software development. I am a very creative person and I love to pour my creativity into my work. I am a quick learner and I like learning new things. I am also extremely resourceful. 
                        If I don't know how to do something, I figure it out! I am very eager to further my knowledge and skills. My vision is to keep moving forward in my career.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        I like challenges in my position. Web development has become a perfect challenging outlet where I can apply my creativity. 
                        I love seeing the results of my efforts in helping users and the company. I also love the logic and structure of coding and strive to write scalable and efficient code. 
                        My current position as a Digital Accessibility Developer has greatly increased my accessibility awareness. 
                        I am passionate about creating an accessible design that helps a wide variety of audiences. 
                        I am also a problem solver. I have a knack for identifying and solving bugs in code.

                        I enjoy doing things with my family and friends. I like playing video games, reading novels, and cooking. I love working out and taking bike rides. 
                        My love for food and coffee is eternal. Baking with my family is one of my favorite things to do. I also enjoy decorating and organizing. 
                        I like living in an organized environment as opposed to clutter. Others have told me that I think outside the box to get something done.

                        <p>
                            This position has really allowed me to grow in my career. My responsibilities include web development, content management, accessibility and training.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In regards to accessibility, I created training materials and conducted live training for faculty and staff on creating digital accessibility. I also
                            continuously improve the accessibility of the website which resulted in 15% increase in the accessibility pushing to WCAG AA compliance. This requires running accessibility tests using automated checkers, screen reader
                            tests and keyboard accessibility tests. I document the accessibility issues and solutions in detail and collaborate with senior Web Developers to implement 
                            those changes. I also serve as a member of accessibility training subcommittee to find ways to increase accessibility awareness and brainstorm ideas to train fellow employees.
                            In addition, I also remediate PDF documents for accessibility and upload them on the website in a timely manner.
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            I create webpages, manage the existing content and contribute to Jira service board. I also assist with troubleshooting website bugs and provide solutions.
                            I participate in UAT for the new components we add to the system which includes testing and documenting bugs. 
                            I also manager over 180 users in the TerminalFour CMS and assist them with any errors or questions. Recently I have been working on improving the website 
                            load speed using CDN/PXL so the website can rank higher in the search engine. This project included extensive research. I tested this feature in a test 
                            environment so that it would not affect the whole website. I collaborated with other Web Developers to brainstorm ideas and created a roll out 
                            plan based on the project deadline. We started with small changes, documented the changes in page load speed and bugs. Overall I have learned alot in this position 
                            and I strive to learn more!

                                    It was a great learning experience.
                                    My project included creating a survey analyzer for electronically interpreting and evaluating an
                                    18-page natural health survey questionnaire.
                                </p>
                                <p>I developed the application on electron framework using front-end technology such as JavaScript,
                                    CSS, and HTML. The project included reading
                                    the pdf form of the survey line by line and create a ROF - report of findings which addresses
                                    the priority level of health problems of the person
                                    who took the survey. I successfully reduced the time it takes to analyze the survey by
                                    approximately 67%. Originally it used to take 15-30 mins to analyze and
                                    evaluate the sruvey. Now with the help of the analyzer app it takes less than 5 minutes.
                                    I loved this project since it made me think outside the box and gave me more experience in the
                                    area of being very precise with the data.

                                        I had a great opportunity to participate in the creation of the student portal for New Eden
                                        School Of Natural Health and Herbal Study.
                                        The student portal was created using WordPress and I was in charge of the making the UI
                                        user-appealing and user-friendly.
                                        I was also responsible for attaining the user requirements from the client.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After the portal was created, I worked as a portal management administration assistant. I was
                                        responsible for assisting the lead administrator with managing the
                                        students and also inputting the exams manually on the portal. I also helped the students with
                                        technical and non-technical inquiries which helped me identify the bugs
                                        in the portal.
                
                                        It was a great experience and it helped me develop my administration skills and web-development
                                        skills further.
