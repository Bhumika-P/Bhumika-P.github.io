                            I am Bhumika Bergman, a fellow computer engineer. I graduated in February 2018. This portfolio will give you insight into my career, projects and contact information.

                            
                            One of my favorite mottoes is "There is always room for Improvement". And I thrive to apply it in my life. As a kid, I was fascinated with computers and it didn't 
                            take me long to decide what I wanted to pursue in my future. I have explored many venues in my career and I have learned that I really enjoy programming. 
                            I like web-development, software development. I am a very creative person and I love to pour my creativity into my work. I am a quick learner and I like learning
                            new things. I am very eager to further my knowledge and skills. My vision is to keep moving forward in my career. 
                            </p>
                            <br><p>
                            Other than programming, I enjoy doing things with my family and friends. I like playing video games, reading novels and cooking. 
                            I love working out and taking bike rides. My love for food and coffee is eternal. Baking with my family is one of my favorite things to do.
                            </p>

                                Now I would like to talk a little about my background. I was born in India and I moved to Toronto, Canada in May 2013. I started studying Computer Engineering 
                                at York University in September 2013. And I graduated in February 2018. During my university time, I met my soulmate and we eventually got engaged.  
                                After that, I acquired a K-1 visa and moved to Chicago, IL in December 2018. 
                                I married my fiance on February 23, 2019.
                                I then applied for both green card and work permit. Hence I acquired a work permit and I am eligible to work in the USA. 
                                Currently, I am actively looking for a position
                                as an entry-level front-end/software developer in the Chicago area.

                            My project included creating a survey analyzer for electronically interpreting and evaluating an 18-page natural health survey questionnaire.

                            who took the survey. 
                            I loved this project since it made me think outside the box and gave me more experience in the area of being very precise with the data.

                            I had a great opportunity to participate in the creation of the student portal for New Eden School Of Natural Health and Herbal Study.
                            The student portal was created using WordPress and I was in charge of the making the UI user-appealing and user-friendly. 
                            I was also responsible for attaining the user requirements from the client. 
                        </p><p>    
                            After the portal was created, I worked as a portal management administration assistant. I was responsible for assisting the lead administrator with managing the 
                            students and also inputting the exams manually on the portal. I also helped the students with technical and non-technical inquiries which helped me identify the bugs
                            in the portal.

                            It was a great experience and it helped me develop my administration skills and web-development skills further.

                            <br>
                            <p>
                                This was a great in-class project which helped me dive further into mobile app development. My project was very critical since it included dealing with 
                                a serious medical condition. AMD means age-related macular degeneration. It is deterioration of the macula, which is the small central area of the retina of the eye that 
                                controls visual acuity. It produces a slow, painless loss of vision and the patient loses central vision. They can not see fine details, whether they're looking
                                at something close or far.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I created the app using Android studio. I also used a Firebase database to store the patient information, test results and test patterns. 
                                The patients first had to register and then login in order to use the application. 
                                The mobile app included showing random straight lines of different sizes with a red dot in the center. The AMD patients may see some of 
                                the lines as wavy or blurred, with some dark areas at center. The app included displaying lines one after another and the patient will tap/voice "yes" if they see
                                the line straight or "no" if they don't see a straight line. The test results were stored in the Firebase database for later use and also displayed in the app.
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was a very memorable experience for me. I had many failures along the way but I was able to achieve the goal and meet the deadline for the project.

                                This project included implementing a secure messenger system that can be used in a hospital. 
                                The first step to creating this system was to write acceptance tests and actual tests. I also met with the clients(in this case 
                                the TA and the professor) to derive user requirements. 
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                    The users(e.g. doctors, nurses, administrators) first have to register to the system using an ID and a name. The messenger system must support the 
                                    ability of users to send text messages. 
                                    There are also groups and users are members of groups and when they send a message it is always to a group, with the privacy condition that only 
                                    members of that group may read the message. Users may become members of any number of groups. Users may send messages only to the members of a group 
                                    they are registered in. Users may only access/read a message from a group they are registered in. 
                                    Once a message is read by the recipient, its status changes from new to old. Users may delete their old messages.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The system provides the following queries: list_users (ID → name) and list_groups (ID → name), both sorted by name. 
                                    Components of the abstract state are always sorted by ID, except for the list of users, or lists of groups (as above). 
                                    Lists of new and old messages for a user, are sorted by message ID. The other commands are: add_user(user_id, name),add_group(group_id,g_name),  
                                    register_user(user_id,group_id), list_old_messages(user_id), list_new_messages(user_id), set_message_preview(char_count), 
                                    delete_message(user_id,message_id), read_message(user_id,message_id), send_message(user_id, group_id,message), 
                                    
                                    Each user command shall be followed by the abstract state space. Queries shall display results only, not the abstract state.

                                    I created this system using JAVA. I exploited the properties of "Maps", "Sets", "Lists" and "Iterators". 

                                    I achieved the project goal within the given time frame and met the client requirements.

                                This was a great learning experience in the area of software development. I had an opportunity to learn to write acceptance tests, actual tests and use cases.
                                I also learned that elicitating the user requirements is just as important as writing the code.

                                This project was about creating a smart water bottle. I was a team member of the software team. The main function of the water bottle is to
                                measure and monitor the hydration of the user. We created the mobile application using Android Studio. The app interacts with the bottle using Bluetooth.
                                When the user uses the bottle to drink water, the hardware keeps a record of the fluid level and sends the data to the mobile app. The user can then interacts
                                with the app to check the hydration level.

                                    We achieved the project goal within the limited time frame. 

                                    This was a challenging project for me since it involved interaction with hardware using short-range technology such as Bluetooth. Anyhow I enjoyed 
                                    learning something new.

                                I was a team member of a team working on creating a VEX robot.  This was a very challenging project for me since
                                this was my first time working on any robot. The project was to first create the robot and then configure it to run through an obstacle course. The wooden obstacle 
                                course consists of ramps and walls. We had to configure the robot to run on both autonomous and the remote controlled mode.  In remote controlled mode, we had to use
                                a controller to run as many laps as possible in three minutes. While autonomous mode was more challenging since passing the obstacles solely depended on
                                the motors and sensors. We used ultrasonic sensors to detect walls in order to make turns.
