                        I am Bhumika Bergman, a fellow computer engineer. I graduated in February 2018. This portfolio
                        will give you insight into my career, projects and contact information.


                        One of my favorite mottoes is "There is always room for Improvement". And I thrive to apply it
                        in my life. As a kid, I was fascinated with computers and it didn't
                        take me long to decide what I wanted to pursue in my future. I have explored many venues in my
                        career and I have learned that I really enjoy programming.
                        I like web-development, software development. I am a very creative person and I love to pour my
                        creativity into my work. I am a quick learner and I like learning
                        new things. I am very eager to further my knowledge and skills. My vision is to keep moving
                        forward in my career.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Other than programming, I enjoy doing things with my family and friends. I like playing video
                        games, reading novels and cooking.
                        I love working out and taking bike rides. My love for food and coffee is eternal. Baking with my
                        family is one of my favorite things to do.
                        I also enjoy decorating and organizing. I like living in an organized environment as opposed to
                        clutter.
                        Others have told me that I think outside the box to get something done.

                    <p>
                        Now I would like to talk a little about my background. I was born in India. After highschool, I
                        enrolled in
                        Computer Engineering at MS University located at Gujarat, India in May 2011. After two years of
                        engineering, I moved to Toronto, Canada in May 2013.
                        I wanted to continue schooling in Computer Engineering at York University but I was told that
                        I have to start from beginning and I can't continue where I left off back in India because most
                        of my credits weren't recognized
                        . I started studying first year
                        Computer Engineering in September 2013. And I graduated in February 2018. During my university
                        time, I met my soulmate and we eventually got engaged.
                        After that, I acquired a K-1 visa and moved to Chicago, IL in December 2018.
                        I married my fiance on February 23, 2019.
                        I then applied for both green card and work permit. Hence I acquired a work permit and I am
                        eligible to work in the USA.
                        Currently, I am actively looking for a position
                        as an entry-level front-end/software developer in the Chicago area.

                        <p>
                            This position has really allowed me to grow in my career. My responsibilities include web development, content management, accessibility and training.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In regards to accessibility, I created training materials and conducted live training for faculty and staff on creating digital accessibility. I also
                            continuously improve the accessibility of the website which resulted in 15% increase in the accessibility pushing to WCAG AA compliance. This requires running accessibility tests using automated checkers, screen reader
                            tests and keyboard accessibility tests. I document the accessibility issues and solutions in detail and collaborate with senior Web Developers to implement 
                            those changes. I also serve as a member of accessibility training subcommittee to find ways to increase accessibility awareness and brainstorm ideas to train fellow employees.
                            In addition, I also remediate PDF documents for accessibility and upload them on the website in a timely manner.
                        </p>
                        <p>   
                            I create webpages, manage the existing content and contribute to Jira service board. I also assist with troubleshooting website bugs and provide solutions.
                            I participate in UAT for the new components we add to the system which includes testing and documenting bugs. 
                            I also manager over 180 users in the TerminalFour CMS and assist them with any errors or questions. Recently I have been working on improving the website 
                            load speed using CDN/PXL so the website can rank higher in the search engine. This project included extensive research. I tested this feature in a test 
                            environment so that it would not affect the whole website. I collaborated with other Web Developers to brainstorm ideas and created a roll out 
                            plan based on the project deadline. We started with small changes, documented the changes in page load speed and bugs. Overall I have learned alot in this position 
                            and I strive to learn more!

                                My job was to create a website for the school and manage it.

                                I created the website on Weebly platform with student registration, login, and eCommerce. My
                                main goal was to make the website user-friendly where students who are not so comfortable with

                                    I had the opportunity to work at Primitius International as a freelance application developer.
                                    It was a great learning experience.
                                    My project included creating a survey analyzer for electronically interpreting and evaluating an
                                    18-page natural health survey questionnaire.
                                </p>
                                <p>I developed the application on electron framework using front-end technology such as JavaScript,
                                    CSS, and HTML. The project included reading
                                    the pdf form of the survey line by line and create a ROF - report of findings which addresses
                                    the priority level of health problems of the person
                                    who took the survey. I successfully reduced the time it takes to analyze the survey by
                                    approximately 67%. Originally it used to take 15-30 mins to analyze and
                                    evaluate the sruvey. Now with the help of the analyzer app it takes less than 5 minutes.
                                    I loved this project since it made me think outside the box and gave me more experience in the
                                    area of being very precise with the data.

                                        I had a great opportunity to participate in the creation of the student portal for New Eden
                                        School Of Natural Health and Herbal Study.
                                        The student portal was created using WordPress and I was in charge of the making the UI
                                        user-appealing and user-friendly.
                                        I was also responsible for attaining the user requirements from the client.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After the portal was created, I worked as a portal management administration assistant. I was
                                        responsible for assisting the lead administrator with managing the
                                        students and also inputting the exams manually on the portal. I also helped the students with
                                        technical and non-technical inquiries which helped me identify the bugs
                                        in the portal.
                
                                        It was a great experience and it helped me develop my administration skills and web-development
                                        skills further.
